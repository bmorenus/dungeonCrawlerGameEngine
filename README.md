## Dungeon Crawler Game Engine

The Dungeon Crawler Game Engine allows users to develop their own dungeon
crawler game by loading their own sprites and tiles while creating unique
levels that fit their style of play.

The engine features a UI developed with the ImGui UI library that allows
players to list and select their characters and tiles for placement within
the scene. Additionally, the UI offers a save/load level feature that allows
game creators to save their game levels and upload them as part of the
game package provided to their users.
